# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [0.3.1] - 2018-02-07
### Bugfixes
- Fix broker state listener states on some corner-case
  error handling in coherence manager that might cause it
  to have both listener and broker event listeners registered
  with the ipsub channel

## [0.3.0] - 2017-12-06
### Bugfixes
- Fix NamespaceMirrorWrapper.clear by properly proxying
  writes on revision and revmark_ttl
- Make LazyCuckooCache's rehash (resize) operation
  atomic to avoid concurrent rehashing, which can cause
  corruption and crashes in rare corner cases, most
  notably with non-preallocated caches that grow very
  rapidly from concurrent writer threads and cause
  eviction callbacks due to hash collisions during
  rehashing.

### Changed
- Each client has a different logger

## [0.2.1] - 2017-10-12
### Bugfixes
- Fix TieredInclusiveClient's handling of REGET during
  coherence. In cases where high load might make the
  L1 expiration be missed by the time putnext gets
  the REGET reply, the way REGET was implemented might
  step on fresh values of the cache with old ones
  inadvertantly. Check the values' TTL befure using it
  in a REGET, inhibit caller's reget, and use promotion
  logic instead.

## [0.2.0] - 2017-09-20
### Changed
- Made ttl_skip not return default/CacheMissError when the
  only available value is below the skip threshold. Instead,
  return the available item as does TieredInclusiveCache.
  The logic works better with lazy decorators and async
  refresh in this way, and is more uniform across clients.
- FastMemcachedClient: Refresh DNS in the bgwriter thread
  to avoid latency spikes caused by DNS queries

### Added
- Support for getMulti and getTtlMulti to all clients,
  with optimized versions for memcached
- An option tcp_nodelay to MemcachedStoreClient to reduce
  latency in latency-sensitive applications
- Add a LazyCuckooCache implementing a lazy form of
  cuckoo hashing (ie: without relocation) to implement a
  quasi-LRU eviction strategy with O(1) reads and updates

## [0.1.0]

Initial release
